## 1.2 What is the internet network?

*Internet (World Wide Web)* - a global communication network, that connects computer networks.
*Client* - any application or software which asks for data from the server. The client applications are operated by the end users. 
*Server* - a computer that shares data with the clients.
*Browser* - The browser is an application that allows showing internet pages. The browser is defined as a client-side application.
*IP address* - the address of each equipment that connects to the internet network (IP - Internet Protocol). The IP address consists of four numbers in the ranges of 0-255, separated by dots. 

The command 'ipconfig' in the command line allows revealing the IP address of a device (usually under "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi").
The command 'ping' in the command line allows revealing if two computers are linked one to the other through the internet network.
